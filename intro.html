            Introduction
                <p>Welcome to A Dragonborn's Fate, a fully modular vanilla-plus modding guide for Skyrim Special Edition!</p>
        </h2>
        <blockquote class="blockquote">
            IMPORTANT: Everything in this guide is written down for a reason! It is vital to read <b>everything!</b>
            You can NOT skip any paragraphs/instructions and expect your game to function as it should.

            <p class="subparagraph">
                    A Dragonborn's Fate is a modding guide for Skyrim Special Edition that will carefully walk you through how to install all the mods you will need for a perfectly stable, smooth, and most importantly, enjoyable experience.
                    Unlike other modding guides, it is built with customization in mind. Mods are subjective, so every mod listed in the guide is 100% optional.
                    Hand-made conflict resolution and load order will be provided at the end of the guide. The conflict resolution will be supplied in a fully-modular FOMOD installer, meaning that you can still use it even if you skip any mods.
                    <br> <br>
                    The guide is highly accessible for everyone, no matter your modding experience.
                    It is still incredibly important that you read all the instructions very carefully, even if you believe you are experienced enough to skip them.
                    There are many small instructions that are vital for your game to function, and could be easily missed if you aren't careful. Although you don't need any modding experience to use this guide,
                    it is expected for you to be relatively experienced with operating a computer in general.
            </p>

            <a class="internallink" href="#features"><p class="smallheader" id="features">Features:</p></a>
                <ul class="standard_ul">
                    <li>
                        <b>Stability:</b>
                            Don't let crashing be a core feature of the game anymore! The guide includes all essential stability enhancements and no placebo/dangerous mods.
                            With a complete install of the guide, you should have zero crashes! Of course there are no guarantees with Skyrim though.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Performance:</b>
                            Every tool, setting, and mod in the guide has been carefully selected and play-tested to ensure maximum possible performance.
                            No 4k texture mods, no ENBs, no heavily-scripted mods, or any other un-optimized/broken mods.
                            With my mid-range PC at 1080p resolution, I get around 130 FPS almost everywhere.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Better Gameplay:</b>
                            The guide includes many mods that greatly improve the gameplay, without drastically overhauling the core experience or straying away from the game's lore.
                            The gameplay section is headlined by <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/67410746" target="_blank">SimonMagus616's</a> lightweight
                            gameplay overhaul mods. <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39414" target="_blank">SunHelm</a> is also used to add a fully-featured survival system.
                            As was mentioned earlier, the guide is fully modular so you can skip any mods in the gameplay section if you don't like them. The guide is specifically designed to fit and playstyle 
                            and difficulty.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Custom Mods and Patches:</b>
                            When needed, the guide will provide custom mods, addendums to existing mods, or patches for mods to make them compatible and consistent with the guide.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Customizability:</b>
                            The guide is fully modular, every mod listed is 100% optional. Hand-made conflict resolution load order will be provided, and they will work perfectly even if you left out any mods.
                            For information regarding adding your own mods, see the <a href="./intro.html#additional_mods">Additional Mods</a> section below.

                <ul class="standard_ul">
                    <li>An English copy of the game with all DLCs from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/489830/" target="_blank">Steam</a> (instructions for properly installing it are in the next step)</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Only the English version of the game is supported for maximum compatibility. Bethesda.net, Xbox Game Pass, and pirated versions of the game are also unsupported, as they do not work with SKSE which is essential for many mods.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>At least 15 GB of free drive space</li>

                    <li>A text editor (I recommend <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/" target="_blank">Notepad++</a>, but the default Windows notepad will work)</li>
                    <li>An archiving tool (I recommend <a href="https://www.7-zip.org/" target="_blank">7-Zip</a>)</li>

                    If you are looking to add more mods to your setup, please wait until <b>after</b> you have completed the guide, or else we will be unable to help you on Discord should you need it.
                    Unfortunately, I do not have the time or energy to provide support for setups that install extra mods on top of the guide.
                    I can not stress enough that is only recommend to add your own mods if you are an experienced modder and know how to manually make conflict resolution patches and sort your load order!
                    You can't just throw a bunch of mods on top of the guide without doing any conflict resolution or use automated tools and except your game to function as intended!
                    A reminder that I will not supported setups that have added any mods

        <a class="internallink" href="#recommended_specs"><h2 class="subheader" id="recommended_specs">Recommended Specs:</h2></a>
                <p class="subparagraph">
                    The guide will make the game run better than vanilla. The game is much CPU-intensive than GPU-intensive, and unlike other Bethesda games, it actually handles modern hardware pretty well.
                    Installing the game on an SSD can drastically improve load times and decrease stuttering. Here are the recommended specs for being able to run the guide at 60FPS in 1080p:
                    <br> <br>
                        <ul class="standard_ul">
                            <li><b>CPU:</b> Modern quad-core processor (2.75GHz or more)</li>
                            <li><b>RAM:</b> 8GB of RAM </li>
                            <li><b>GPU:</b> NVIDIA 900 series card or an AMD RX 400 series card</li>
                        </ul>
