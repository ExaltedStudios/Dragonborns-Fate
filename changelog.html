           Changelog
        </h2>
            <h2 class="subparagraph"><strong>Time formatted in mm/dd/yy</strong></h2>
                <h2 class="install">10/09/21</h2>
                    <p class="subparagraph">
                        <strong>User Interface:</strong> Added Recleaned Menu <br>
                        <strong>Visuals:</strong> Replaced Realistic Water Two + Better Water for RW2 with Cathedral Waters (much simpler and just as effective imo, fits the guide much more)
                    </p>
            <h2 class="install">8/16/21</h2>
                <p class="subparagraph">
                    <b>Additions:</b> <br>
                    <strong>Utilities:</strong> Added powerofthree's Papyrus Extender (now required for SunHelm) <br>
                    <strong>Gameplay:</strong> Added instructions to also install the Food and Drink addon from Apothecary <br> <br>
                    <b>Removals (a Qolore7 guide staple:)</b> <br>
                    <strong>Visuals:</strong> Removed support for ELE, instead adding a note about not selecting the ELFX Enhancer setting in the ELFX FOMOD if you have a weaker PC or don't like the "realistically" dark interiors <br>
                    <strong>Gameplay:</strong> Removed support for EnaiRim (didn't feel like maintaining it anymore, especially since most people use SimonRim. EnaiRim only required one minor patch with Scarcity that was more of a consistency patch than a necessity, so in theory it is still incredibly easy to swap Simon for Enai) <br>
                    <strong>Finish Line:</strong> Updated the load order and conflict resolution to reflect these changes (important thing to note: although neither Realistic Water 2 and SunHelm have been removed, the patch for the two has been removed from the FOMOD. This is because it is no longer necessary as of SunHelm v3.0.0. SunHelm v3 also requires a new save)
                </p>

                  <p class="subparagraph">
                    This update took place over the course of a couple weeks, so excuse me if I miss anything here: <br> <br>
                    <b>Additions:</b> <br>
                    <strong>Bug Fixes:</strong> Added instructions to enable a couple features in SSE Engine Fixes' config <br>
                    <strong>Bug Fixes:</strong> Added NPC Position Process Fix <br>
                    <strong>Bug Fixes:</strong> Added Tavern AI Fix <br>
                    <strong>Tweaks:</strong> New section, separated Bug Fixes and QOL Improvements basically  <br>
                    <strong>Tweaks:</strong> Added Bounty Preview <br>
                    <strong>Tweaks:</strong> Added All Thieves Guild Jobs Concurrently <br>
                    <strong>Tweaks:</strong> Added Simple Offence suppression <br>
                    <strong>Tweaks:</strong> Added Disable Cinematic Kills <br>
                    <strong>UI:</strong> Added Roboto Font Replacer <br>
                    <strong>UI:</strong> Added Smaller Vanilla Cursors <br>
                    <strong>UI:</strong> Added Horse Stamina HUD <br>
                    <strong>Visuals:</strong> Added ELFX Fixes <br>
                    <strong>Visuals:</strong> Added Dimmer Fog <br>
                    <strong>Visuals:</strong> Added Blended Roads <br>
                    <strong>Visuals:</strong> Realistic Water Two <br>
                    <strong>Visuals:</strong> Better Water for Realistic Water Two <br>
                    <strong>Gameplay:</strong> (both sections): Added SunHelm <br>
                    <strong>SimonRim:</strong> Added Apothecary <br>
                    <strong>EnaiRim:</strong> Added Tonics Heal Over Time <br> <br>
                    <b>Removals:</b> <br>
                    <strong>Bug Fixes:</strong> Removed 1st Person Sneak Stutter Fix (too specific of a fix to warrant including) <br>
                    <strong>Bug Fixes:</strong> Removed Minimalistic AutoSave Mod (didn't like the sudden stuttering when autosaving, instead opting for the setting in SSE Engine Fixes that makes F5 create an autosave) <br>
                    <strong>UI:</strong> Removed MoreHUD Inventory Edition (didn't have any useful info imo) <br>
                    <strong>Gameplay:</strong> Removed M'aiq's Tweaks Better Sneaking (ended up making sneak to easy/awkward) <br>
                    <strong>Gameplay:</strong> Removed Alchemy Potions and Food Adjustments (replaced by Apothecary in SimonRim and Tonics Heal Over Time in EnaiRim)

                  <p class="subparagraph">
                    - <strong>Visuals:</strong> Added back ELFX as an alternative to ELE, since I know some people (myself included) much prefer how it looks to ELE despite its potential performance impact. ELFX will be recommended for higher-end PCs and ELE will be for lower-end ones
                  </p>

                <h2 class="install">2/23/21</h2>
                    <p class="subparagraph">
                        First round of changes, thanks to everyone who gave feedback! <br> <br>
                        - [Bug Fixes] Added Miscellaneous Tweaks Collection (just the Better Horses file) <br>
                        - [HUD] Added both Better MessageBox and Better Dialogue Controls <br>
                        - [Gameplay] Removed Apocalypse (too ambitious of a mod to be included in a Vanilla Plus guide) <br>
                        - [Gameplay] Removed MorrowLoot Ultimate (after play-testing, unleveling the game sounds a lot better in theory than it is in practice. Someone also made a great point about being able to exploit the hand-placed glass/ebony items if you know where they are) <br>
                        - [Gameplay] Added MorrowLoot Miscellania (just the Unleveled Quest Rewards option, since I still do believe this feature is balanced) <br>
                        - [Gameplay] Added both Encounter Zones Unlocked and Arena - An Encounter Zone Overhaul (better than unleveled enemies imo) <br>
                        - [Finish] Updated both the load order and conflict resolutions to reflect the changes (also added a couple new patches that I previously missed)
                    </p>
